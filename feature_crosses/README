In this, we get to learn the indispensable role of features crosses in linear predictive model.

We have two diffrent features say, x1 and x2, their product (cross product) x1x2 would encode nonlinearity within a linear model helping in better and most accurate prediction. This product sometimes form a logical conjuction in one-hot encoding.

With this tactic a model can deal with massive amount of data. This entire process is called Synthesizing features.
