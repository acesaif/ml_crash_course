Now its time to really try out things on my own and implement __`TensorFlow API`__ on different datasets. This directory is only for my application of knowledge that I gained these days. Busy implmenting the practice.

### Databases

* __Biology__

  * `Crabs Dataset` ([here](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/PRNN/crabs.dat)).
  * `Breast Cancer UCI Dataset` ([here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data/data))
