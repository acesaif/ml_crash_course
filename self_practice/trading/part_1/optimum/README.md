## Understanding Optimization with `scipy`

#### Requires `scipy` package.

```
$ pip2 install scipy --user
$ python2
```
```python
>>>
>>> from scipy import optimize as opt
>>>
```

Here are my two plots showing __`optimization`__ performance.

__`Fit a Line`__ | __`Fit a Polynomial`__

Here I did fit a line. | Here I did fit a 4th degree polynomial. |

##### These algorithms are beautiful.
