Here we learn on how to partition the dataset into 3 sets, Training set, Validation set and Test set.
We train our model, on Training set validate it to Validation set and iterate this process until we get the best result.
Finally we apply that model on Test set and compare the results.

Important: Exceeded level of training on the same dataset and validating could make the model obsolete.
